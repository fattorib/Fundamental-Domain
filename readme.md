# Fundamental Domain Sections
This is companion code for a visualization during my second talk given in MAT477. 

The code generates a section of the fundamental domain for the action of the special linear group on the space of (integral) binary cubic forms.

## Code
As it stands, this code is inefficient (three nested for loops). It would be fun to come back to this one day, clean it up and make it more professional.
